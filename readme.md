# Tonic Moon and Facing Space
![image](images/tonicmoon_logo_onblack.png)
In November 2021 I hooked up with the Tonic Moon development team to help produce Facing Space, a visual novel that we entered in the 2021 Cultural Heritage Game Jam, sponsored by the Cultural Antiquities Task Force (CATF), part of the U.S. Department of Stateâ€™s Cultural Heritage Coordinating Committee. 
We all overlapped in our responsibilities a bit, but we had one person whose primary responsibility was narrative and logo design, one who did project management and visual assets, one who composed the music... and (over a period of four days) I was the coder who made it all come to life. :-)
